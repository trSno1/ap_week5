# a function allos us to bundle code into reusabel blocks, making it easier to manage and understand,  by defining functions, we can avoid code duplication and enhance readability
# define a function

    #recatoring means to restructure cod3e without chanfinf its extermna; behavior this helps improve readibility and maintainability.
    # # Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
    # # Basic Indexing:
    # # Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
    # # a. Retrieve the 5th character.
    # # b. Retrieve the second to last character.
    # # c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.+

    second_to_last_char = magic[-2]
    first_occurrence_c = magic.find('c')
